The main thing I expect people will want to contribute is
[episode transcripts](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki). This was [an overwelmingly popular feature request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/326565/1438). I
made the licence for my code
[MIT](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE),
but the wiki is under the same licence as user contributions on Stack
Exchange:
[CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

If you would like to help transcribe and get an early preview of
upcoming episodes, you can join the **Transcription Club**. Here's how
it works:

1. Transcribe a few minutes of audio of a published episode on
   [the wiki](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki).

2. Email me at jericson@stackexchange.com with the subject "I want to
   join the Transcription Club!" Please tell me how you'd like to be
   credited in the show notes.

3. When a new episode is ready to be trascribed, I'll email out a
   Google doc to the club that includes a link to a future
   episode. (Please don't share that link or the document with
   anyone!)

4. As you listen to the new episode, trascribe a couple of minutes to
   help people who want to read what's said. (Please leave a timestamp
   when you start and stop so future transcribers can jump to the
   right spot in the audio.)

5. When the episode is published, I'll put the transcript on the wiki
   and also credit anyone who helped in the show notes.

6. Once each episode is fully transcribed (or if I publish it), I'll
   send out the next episode for transcription.

7. If you don't have the time, energy or interest to transcibe
   episodes, just let me know and I'll take you off the mailing list.



Thank you for your generous donation of time and effort to help others!
