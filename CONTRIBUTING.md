The main thing I expect people will want to contribute is [episode transcripts](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki). I made the licence for my code [MIT](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE), but the wiki is under the same licence as user contributions on Stack Exchange: [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Thank you for your generous donation of time and effort to help others!
