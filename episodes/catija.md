Back in May, Jon interviewed me ([Catija](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/313086/welcome-stack-overflow-valued-associate-599-catherine-kuck-aka-catija)) 
while we were both in NYC for a meetup. Serendipitously, I get to share it with y'all on the one-year anniversary of my first day working for Stack Exchange. 
The interview was a lot of fun to do and I hope you enjoy listening to it!

### Transcript

Some users have generously volunteered to transcribe episodes on
[the podcast wiki](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki). 

### Meta

Jon Ericson interviewed several community managers at our most recent
meet-up. There were three questions:

1. What, if anything, gets you excited about your job?
2. How did your life experience before Stack Exchange prepare you for
   this role?
3. What is your favorite site?

We're running these interviews for the summer (or winter, if you are
in the southern hemisphere) and we'll be back to the regular format
around August.
