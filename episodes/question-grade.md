### Meta

It was my turn to host and I think I'm not overly biased when I say
that Abby and Juan do a much better job in that role. For one thing, I
was pretty anxious that we'd end the recording before we ran out of
things to talk about. Not entirely unrelated: I say the word
"template" in a weird way.

It didn't make the recording, but Abby started talking to her cat
right after we said goodbye.
