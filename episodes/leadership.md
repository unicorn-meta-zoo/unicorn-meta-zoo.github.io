* Abby's definition of a leader reminds me of the
[Potter Stewart test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).
* Joel's book is [_Smart and Gets Things Done_](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/).
* We set up a [Team](https://stackoverflow.com/teams) just for out
moderators to share their wisdom and knowledge.
* Our elections uses a
  [single transferable vote system](https://stackoverflow.blog/2016/03/01/fair-elections-and-stv/) for taking your preferences into account.

### Meta

"This is the [no touching](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gDCd.gif)
podcast." This is certainly correct since none of us are even in the
same state. If anyone ever asks you to explain a double entendre,
change the subject immediately as every word out of your mouth will
instantly take on an unintended sexual meaning.

My title really did change to
[Community Product Manager](https://jlericson.com/2019/05/02/community_product_manager.html). It's mostly ceremonial.

["Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people"](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/228032106859749377)
could be a leadership motto. It's tempting to blame folks for problems
we have as Community Managers. On the other hand, we benefit from
leaders empowering others to accomplish our goals. I am forever in
their debt.
