Welcome to the Unicorn Meta Zoo, a podcast by members of the Stack

Back in May, I interviewed [Nicolas](https://stackoverflow.blog/2015/06/11/welcome-nicolas-chabanovsky-and-stack-overflow-in-russian/) 
while we both were in NYC for a meetup. Nicolas has been instrumental in helping out international Stack Overflow sites to be among [the most active on the network](https://stackexchange.com/sites#questionsperday).

### Meta

Jon Ericson interviewed several community managers at our most recent
meet-up. There were three questions:

1. What, if anything, gets you excited about your job?
2. How did your life experience before Stack Exchange prepare you for
   this role?
3. What is your favorite site?

We're running these interviews for the summer (or winter, if you are
in the southern hemisphere) and we'll be back to the regular format
next episode.
