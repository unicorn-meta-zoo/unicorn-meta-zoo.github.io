* I'm not sure if this is the article Abby was talking about, but
  [The Paradigmatic Nature of Biblical Law](http://www.rodneychrisman.com/2010/08/11/the-paradigmatic-nature-of-biblical-law/)
  is something our team has discussed over the years. A key quote:

    > Ancient laws did not work this way. They were paradigmatic,
    > giving models of behaviors and models of
    > prohibitions/punishments relative to those behaviors, but they
    > made no attempt to be exhaustive.  Ancient laws gave guiding
    > principles, or samples, rather than complete descriptions of all
    > things regulated.  Ancient people were expected to be able to
    > extrapolate from what the sampling of laws did say to the
    > _general_ behavior the laws in their totality pointed toward.
    > Ancient judges were expected to extrapolate from the wording
    > provided in the laws that did exist to _all other_ circumstances
    > and not to be foiled in their jurisprudence by any such concepts
    > as “technicalities” or “loopholes.”

   If that's not the right link, it's still fascinating. ;-)

* Many of the CMs took the
  [TKI conflict style assessment](https://kilmanndiagnostics.com/overview-thomas-kilmann-conflict-mode-instrument-tki/) a few years ago. Most
  of us preferred conflict avoidance, which probably explains a lot.

### Meta

Juan remembered that Abby mentioned that difficult users are not
always "negative", but couldn't remember the other word she
used. Listening back, I can't tell what word he forgot. Maybe
"problem"?

Since this podcast was recorded back in April, if you are having a
conflict with one of us right now, we weren't talking about you. After
many years of interacting with members of the community, we've accumulated plenty of experience with just about every sort of person you can imagine. So any similarities to specific individuals are entirely coincidental.
