### Transcript

I
[used YouTube](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
to produce
[a raw, automated transcript](https://unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/episodes/moderation.sbv)
of this episode. There is a
[wiki for transcripts](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki),
if you'd like to produce a cleaner, more coherent transcript. I'm
extremely grateful for users who helped fill in most of
[the first episode's transcript](https://github.com/unicorn-meta-zoo/unicorn-meta-zoo.github.io/wiki/Why-another-podcast%3F-%5BTranscript%5D):

### Meta

Moments before the start of this episode, Abby asked if the name of
the podcast is "Meta Petting Zoo". In the heat of the moment I
couldn't remember and just said yes. In reality, the name we decided
on was "Unicorn Meta Zoo" based on actual
[unicorn petting zoos](http://www.allgodscreatures.net/Unicorns.html). Abby
just changed to the wrong word to "meta".

At around the 18:40 mark in the recording you can hear Abby's tea
slide off her tilted desk and fall on the floor. No mugs were harmed
in the making of this podcast. The same can't be said of the tea.

For some reason, Juan's channel got really noisy in the beginning of
the episode with my podcast editing script. I fixed the problem by
[making the pre-channel loudness normalization optional](https://github.com/jericson/edit_podcast.rb/commit/c04f1f9af1f3306cd6bce87aaf11a58e1293c63d).
